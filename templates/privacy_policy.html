                                        <p><strong>Communications:</strong> When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to
                                        receive messages from other users, businesses, and Bossing Up. You can manage some of your
                                        messaging preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving
                                        certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Bossing Up. For example, if you
                                        order an item or request a quote from a business through the Service, we may send you messages
                                        about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated
                                        SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the
                                        messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or
                                        forwarded such messages, and share that information with other parties to your messages (for
                                        example, to let them know if you have viewed their message). When a user requests a quote or
                                        similar information from multiple businesses through the Service, we may disclose to those
                                        businesses information about the status of the user’s requests, such as whether any business has
                                        responded to the request, the type of response provided (for example, a quote or a request for more
                                        information), and whether the user has responded to any business’s reply. <strong>If you exchange
                                        messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver
                                        them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with
                                        investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</strong> We

                                        our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the

                                        collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need
                                        the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our
                                        legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and
                                        freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from

                                        another person (for instance, to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection
                                        with the Service or to comply with legal obligations). If we ask you to provide personal
                                        information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make
                                        this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is
                                        mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal
                                        information). If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate
                                        interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate our Services,

                                    <li>Content Partners: We allow third party partners to use and display some of the public content
available through the Service, such as your photos, reviews, and other information listed under
“Public Content” in Section 1 above.</li>

                                    <li>Service Providers: We rely on third party service providers to support or provide services for us
in connection with your use of the Service, such as food delivery services, communications and
hosting, security and fraud prevention, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting
usage of the Service, quality assurance testing, payment processing, marketing, and other
functions. We share information from or about you with these third party providers so that they
can perform their services or complete your requests. You may be able to limit our access to some
of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or
through the Service’s settings. Bossing Up’s third party service providers may likewise share
information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services
or completing your requests.</li>
                                    <li>Aggregate or Anonymous Information: We share user information in the aggregate with third
parties, such as businesses that are listed on Bossing Up and content distributors. For example, we
disclose the number of users that have been exposed to or interacted with advertisements, or that
we believe visited the physical location of a particular business.</li>
                                    <li>Business Transfers: If another company acquires Bossing Up, or all or substantially all our
assets, that company will possess the same information, and will collect, use, and disclose the
information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                                    <li>Businesses on Bossing Up: We may share information from or about you (such as your city, and
if you provide it, your age and gender), your device type, and your use of the Service (such as
which businesses you bookmark or call, or if you visit a business’s URL) with businesses on
Bossing Up. You may adjust your account settings to increase or decrease the amount of
information we share. Keep in mind that businesses can also view your public activity and posts,
and may receive information from or about you when you transact or communicate with them,
through Bossing Up or otherwise, regardless of your settings (see Section 1 above). Additionally,
if you make a phone call to a business through or in connection with your use of the Service, we

may share information about your call with the business that the business would have received had
you called them directly, such as the date and time of your call and your phone number. You may
be able to limit our ability to collect and share your phone number through your phone settings or
phone service provider.</li>
                                    <li>Investigations and Legal Disclosures: We may investigate and disclose information from or
about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably
necessary to comply with legal or law enforcement processes, such as a search warrant, subpoena,
statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement request; (b) is helpful to
prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service; or (c)
protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. If you flag or
otherwise complain to us about content through the Service, we may share the substance of your
complaint with the contributor of that content in order to provide an opportunity for the
contributor to respond.</li>

                                    <li>Links: The Service may link to third party-controlled websites, like a business’s URL. Except as
set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for
their privacy practices.</li>

                                    <li>Third Party Integrations: If you sign up for, or log into, Bossing Up using a third party service
like Facebook or Google, or link your Bossing Up account to your account with a third party
service like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, we may receive information about you from such
third party service. If you post content to a third party service through the Service, that third party
service will also receive that content, which will be visible to anyone that has access to it through
that third party service. Some of our web pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to you
from our third party partners, while preserving the look and feel of the Service. In such cases,
please note that the information you provide may be transmitted directly to the identified third
party partner. If you interact with businesses through Bossing Up, they will receive whatever
information you choose to share with them, for example contact information you share through
direct messages to the business or your phone number if you call the business.</li>

information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by
using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your
contributions to the Service. Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service
are only private to the extent that both you and the recipient(s) of your messages keep them private.
For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. We may
access, review, and disclose such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the
Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</p>

Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent,
investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal
obligations. We may also maintain residual copies of your personal information in our backup systems.
Please note that businesses cannot remove their business pages, ratings, or reviews by closing their
accounts.</p>

knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has
provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us by emailing us at

commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</p>

                                <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy
will govern our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you. If we make material changes

                                    <p>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
                                </li>

                                <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have certain
rights around Bossing Up’s collection, use, and sharing of their personal information.
Bossing Up does not sell your personal information and will not do so in the future without providing
you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such sale as required by law. Similarly, we do not
offer financial incentives associated with our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal
information.
Bossing Up collects various categories of personal information when you use the Service, including
identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network or device activity information,
geolocation data, and professional information. A more detailed description of the information Bossing
Up collects and how we use it is provided above in Section 1 (Information We Collect and How We

Use It). Section 3 (Third Parties) describes the categories of third parties with whom we share personal
information, and what information may be shared under different circumstances.
If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has
been collected about you, and to access that information. You also have the right to request deletion of
your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow Bossing Up to retain and use
certain personal information notwithstanding your deletion request. You can submit a data rights
request to Bossing Up by emailing us at bossingubiz@gmail.com. We will not discriminate against
you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you
must verify that your agent is authorized to do so.
Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask
companies what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct
marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of
directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request such disclosure. If you have any
questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your preferences, you may contact us at the
address listed above in Section 8.</p>
                                
                                <li style="font-size: 2.35714286em; font-weight: 500; padding-top: 5%; color: black;">
                                    <p>EUROPEAN RESIDENTS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</p>
                                </li>

                                <p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access your personal data, and the right to request
that we correct, update, or delete your personal data. You can object to the processing of your personal
information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, and request portability of your
personal information. Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with
your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not
affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect
processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
consent. The Service generally provides you with a reasonable means to view and change your profile
information and you can opt-out of marketing communications at any time by clicking on the
“unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you or in your account settings. If you
have any questions or comments about the processing of your personal information, you may contact
us as described in Section 8 above.
<br>
For European Residents, please note that the personal information we obtain from or about you may be
transferred, processed, and stored outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy,
including in the United States of America. We take the privacy of our users seriously and therefore
take steps to safeguard your information, including ensuring an adequate level of data protection in
accordance with European Unionf standards in effect as of the date of this Privacy Policy. These steps
include use of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal
information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal
information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection laws. We
have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners
and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
